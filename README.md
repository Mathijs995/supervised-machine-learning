# Supervised Machine Learning
Welcome to the Github repository used for the course Supervised Machine Learning by group 5. The team members in this group are [Chao Liang](mailto:c.liang@businessdatascience.nl), [Yuchou Peng](mailto:y.peng@businessdatascience.nl), [Eva Mynott](mailto:e.mynott@tinbergen.nl) and [Mathijs de Jong](mailto:m.de.jong@tinbergen.nl).


## Setup
To be able to run the code in this file, you have to specify the `BASE.DIR` variable which is done using the `init.R`. In the home directory of this repository, create a file called `init.R` and add the following line to the file (replacing `$YOUR.BASE.DIR` with your local base directory, e.g. `/Users/mathijs/Google Drive/Tinbergen - MPhil/`).
```
BASE.DIR = '$YOUR.BASE.DIR'
```


## Assignments
- **Assignment 1** - Explaining Air Quality with Economic and Environmental Factors ([report](Week%201/SML%20-%20Assignment%201%20-%20Group%205.pdf), [code](Week%201/Assignment))
